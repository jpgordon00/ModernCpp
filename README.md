## PusoedoBanking
A simple banking program using [Modern CPP](https://github.com/TheLartians/ModernCppStarter) starter.

## What is this project?
- A simple banking program that stores records in memory using [signly linked lists](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/data-structures/linked-list/singly-linked-list/).
- Demonstrates my knowledge of C++ and C by creating a project in both C and C++.
> This project uses define statements, IO functions and libraries specific to either a C or C++ standard. It also uses command arguments in its logic.
- Uses a structure that includes CMake and Make support, seperation of source code and headers, and seperation of standalone builds and unit testing.
> Using a modern CPP template ensure that development time is not wasted and the project is flexible. 
- Seperation of includes, source, and standalone makes this project very versitle. Not only can you compile as a standalone program, a library, or any other specific compilation process, they can all exist at the same time without interference.

> [CMakeLists](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html) allow flexible dependent specific compilation. While using just [Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html) would suffice for most compilation situations, there would be a reduntant compilation proccess.
